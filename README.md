## Introduction

* YOLOv5 ðŸš€:

The YOLOv5 algorithm is a cutting-edge object detection model known for its incredible speed and accuracy. It can efficiently detect objects, including vehicles, in various sizes and orientations, making it perfect for real-time applications. This algorithm builds upon the You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture and incorporates advancements like anchor-free bounding box prediction and feature pyramid networks.

* SSD ðŸš€:

The Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD) is another remarkable object detection algorithm. It utilizes a series of convolutional layers to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities at different scales. SSD offers high detection accuracy and real-time performance, making it ideal for vehicle detection scenarios.
